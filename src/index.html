                Hello and thank you for taking the time to check out my first online gallery.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here you will see a collection of peices spanning over a 3 years timeline.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since this is the first gallery, you will see peices from the very beginning to current.
            </p>
            <p>
                Enjoy - Vincent

            <span>This is the first real painting I made and I see it as the start of my era of seriously making art.
                I had just recently discoverd the horror art of Junji Ito and Suehiro Maruo and wanted to recreat something similar
                to them but in my own style. I am actually quite happy with how this ended up looking and wish I could make something similar
                to it now. I made this using procreate and the wet acrylic brush.
