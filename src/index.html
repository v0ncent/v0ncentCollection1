                    Hello and thank you for taking the time to check out my first online gallery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here you will see a collection of peices spanning over a 3 years timeline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since this is the first gallery, you will see peices from the very beginning to current.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have tried to include everything thats worth including since I have first started drawing,<br> but there is just simply too much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enjoy - Vincent

                <h2><u>One</u></h2>
                <span>This is the first real painting I made. I see it as the start of my era of seriously making art.
                    I had just recently discoverd the horror art of Junji Ito and Suehiro Maruo and wanted to recreat something similar
                    to them but in my own style. I am actually quite happy with how this ended up looking and wish I could make something similar
                    to it now. I made this using procreate and the wet acrylic brush.

                    After I made my first peice and posted it to my instagram I created this the very next day. I enjoyed the first one so much I 
                    just had to make another! The hat that is falling is a yacht captain's hat, I like how cleanly I managed to paint it.

                    This one really blew up on imgur for some reason. Maybe its the hands!

                    I honeslty dont have much to say for this one. I wanted to try out a more abstract background and give the people a very painty feel. I love how the woman in front turned out.
